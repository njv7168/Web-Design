## About the game

### Genre

*Galactic Rocket Legend* is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up where the player fights
 through space, while racing against the clock. 

### Platform

*Galactic Rocket Legend* will be available on desktop we browsers, playable with 
 keyboard controls

### Story

The player controls the ship of a vigilante who stole information from the space-pirates
 that will allow his crew to put an end to their destruction. But with the light-speed
 out of order, the player must race back to the base before the pirates get there and
 destroy it. If successful, the vigilante crew will finally become legends
 throughout the galaxy.

### Esthetics

The art style of *Galactic Rocket Legend* will be a cartoon-ish pixelated format. 
Going with the look the sound will be designed to be arcade-esc, with 8-bit sounds
that give the feel of an older arcade game. There will be several sounds such as ones
for taking damage, firing lazers, running out of time (music changing), etc..

### Gameplay

*Galactic Rocket Legend* will have the player controlling a spaceship which they
 control with the keyboard. As a side-scroller the screen will be constantly moving, 
 bringing obstacles and enemies for the player to deal with. Using _'wasd'_ the player
 can navigate around the obstacles in their way. In the case the player can't avoid
 the obstacle they have the ability to shoot a lazer which can destroy objects and 
 enemies by pressing _'space'_. The player will have a health meter, so if they take 
 too many hits they will get a game over. But there is another main function of the 
 game which is the time limit that the player must pay attention to. There is an end
 goal which the player must reach, but they also must do it within the time limit. 
 Running into obstacles will slow down the player for a moment, wasting a bit of time.
 But taking too many hits does not mean winning is hopeless, because the player can 
 press _'shift'_ to speed up the ship. This can save time but is dangerous because 
 the obstacles will come towards the player much quicker. There will be different
 levels of varrying difficulty, with the first being a tutorial to teach the player
 the mechanics.

### Developer

*Galactic Rocket Legend* will be developed by Nicholas Visconti, a second-year 
 Game Design student at RIT
